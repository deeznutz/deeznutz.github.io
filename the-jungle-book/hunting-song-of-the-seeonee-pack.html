<span class="poetry">As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Once, twice and again!</span>
<span class="poetry">And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up</span>
<span class="poetry">From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.</span>
<span class="poetry">This I, scouting alone, beheld,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Once, twice and again!</span>
<span class="poetry">As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Once, twice and again!</span>
<span class="poetry">And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back</span>
<span class="poetry">To carry the word to the waiting pack,</span>
<span class="poetry">And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Once, twice and again!</span>
<span class="poetry">As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Once, twice and again!</span>
<span class="poetry">Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!</span>
<span class="poetry">Eyes that can see in the dark—the dark!</span>
<span class="poetry">Tongue—give tongue to it!  Hark!  O hark!</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Once, twice and again!</span>
