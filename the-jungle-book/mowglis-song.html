<h1 class="chapter-header">Mowgli’s Song</h1>
<p class="prose">(<i>That he sang at the council rock when he danced on Shere Khan's Hide.</i>)</p>
<span class="poetry">The Song of Mowgli—I, Mowgli, am singing.  Let the jungle</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">listen to the things I have done.</span>
<span class="poetry">Shere Khan said he would kill—would kill!  At the gates in the</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">twilight he would kill Mowgli, the Frog!</span>
<span class="poetry">He ate and he drank.  Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">drink again?  Sleep and dream of the kill.</span>
<span class="poetry">I am alone on the grazing-grounds.  Gray Brother, come to me!</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!</span>
<span class="poetry">Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">with the angry eyes.  Drive them to and fro as I order.</span>
<span class="poetry">Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan?  Wake, oh, wake!  Here come I,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">and the bulls are behind.</span>
<span class="poetry">Rama, the King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his foot.  Waters of</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">the Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan?</span>
<span class="poetry">He is not Ikki to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that he should</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">fly.  He is not Mang the Bat, to hang in the branches.  Little bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?</span>
<span class="poetry">Ow!  He is there.  Ahoo!  He is there.  Under the feet of Rama</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">lies the Lame One!  Up, Shere Khan!</span>
<span class="poetry">Up and kill!  Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!</span>
<span class="poetry">Hsh!  He is asleep.  We will not wake him, for his strength is</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">very great.  The kites have come down to see it.  The black ants have come up to know it.  There is a great assembly in his honor.</span>
<span class="poetry">Alala!  I have no cloth to wrap me.  The kites will see that I am</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">naked.  I am ashamed to meet all these people.</span>
<span class="poetry">Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan.  Lend me thy gay striped coat that I</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">may go to the Council Rock.</span>
<span class="poetry">By the Bull that bought me I made a promise—a little promise.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.</span>
<span class="poetry">With the knife, with the knife that men use, with the knife of the</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">hunter, I will stoop down for my gift.</span>
<span class="poetry">Waters of the Waingunga, Shere Khan gives me his coat for the love</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">that he bears me.  Pull, Gray Brother!  Pull, Akela!  Heavy is the hide of Shere Khan.</span>
<span class="poetry">The Man Pack are angry.  They throw stones and talk child’s talk.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">My mouth is bleeding.  Let me run away.</span>
<span class="poetry">Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly with me, my</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">brothers.  We will leave the lights of the village and go to the low moon.</span>
<span class="poetry">Waters of the Waingunga, the Man-Pack have cast me out.  I did</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">them no harm, but they were afraid of me.  Why?</span>
<span class="poetry">Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too.  The jungle is shut to me and</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">the village gates are shut.  Why?</span>
<span class="poetry">As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so fly I between the</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">village and the jungle.  Why?</span>
<span class="poetry">I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy.  My</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but my heart is very light, because I have come back to the jungle. Why?</span>
<span class="poetry">These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">spring.  The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it falls.  Why?</span>
<span class="poetry">I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet.</span>
<span class="poetry">All the jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan.  Look—look</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">well, O Wolves!</span>
<span class="poetry">Ahae!  My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand.</span>
