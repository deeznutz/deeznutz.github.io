<p class="prose">(<i>Sung in honor of Rikki-tikki-tavi</i>)</p>
<span class="poetry">Singer and tailor am I—</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Doubled the joys that I know—</span>
<span class="poetry">Proud of my lilt to the sky,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Proud of the house that I sew—</span>
<span class="poetry">Over and under, so weave I my music—so weave I the house that I</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">sew.</span>
<span class="poetry">Sing to your fledglings again,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Mother, oh lift up your head!</span>
<span class="poetry">Evil that plagued us is slain,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Death in the garden lies dead.</span>
<span class="poetry">Terror that hid in the roses is impotent—flung on the dung-hill and dead!</span>
<span class="poetry">Who has delivered us, who?</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Tell me his nest and his name.</span>
<span class="poetry">Rikki, the valiant, the true,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Tikki, with eyeballs of flame,</span>
<span class="poetry">Rikk-tikki-tikki, the ivory-fanged, the hunter with eyeballs of flame!</span>
<span class="poetry">Give him the Thanks of the Birds,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Bowing with tail feathers spread!</span>
<span class="poetry">Praise him with nightingale words—</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Nay, I will praise him instead.</span>
<span class="poetry">Hear!  I will sing you the praise of the bottle-tailed Rikki, with eyeballs of red!</span>
