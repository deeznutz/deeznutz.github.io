<h1 class="chapter-header">Lukannon</h1>
<p class="prose">This is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when
they are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of
very sad seal National Anthem.</p>
<span class="poetry">I met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!)</span>
<span class="poetry">Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;</span>
<span class="poetry">I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers’ song—</span>
<span class="poetry">The Beaches of Lukannon—two million voices strong.</span>
<span class="poetry">The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,</span>
<span class="poetry">The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,</span>
<span class="poetry">The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame—</span>
<span class="poetry">The Beaches of Lukannon—before the sealers came!</span>
<span class="poetry">I met my mates in the morning (I’ll never meet them more!);</span>
<span class="poetry">They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.</span>
<span class="poetry">And o’er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach</span>
<span class="poetry">We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.</span>
<span class="poetry">The Beaches of Lukannon—the winter wheat so tall—</span>
<span class="poetry">The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!</span>
<span class="poetry">The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!</span>
<span class="poetry">The Beaches of Lukannon—the home where we were born!</span>
<span class="poetry">I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.</span>
<span class="poetry">Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;</span>
<span class="poetry">Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,</span>
<span class="poetry">And still we sing Lukannon—before the sealers came.</span>
<span class="poetry">Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!</span>
<span class="poetry">And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe;</span>
<span class="poetry">Ere, empty as the shark’s egg the tempest flings ashore,</span>
<span class="poetry">The Beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!</span>
