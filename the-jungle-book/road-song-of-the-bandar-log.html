<span class="poetry">Here we go in a flung festoon,</span>
<span class="poetry">Half-way up to the jealous moon!</span>
<span class="poetry">Don’t you envy our pranceful bands?</span>
<span class="poetry">Don’t you wish you had extra hands?</span>
<span class="poetry">Wouldn’t you like if your tails were—so—</span>
<span class="poetry">Curved in the shape of a Cupid’s bow?</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Now you’re angry, but—never mind,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!</span>
<span class="poetry">Here we sit in a branchy row,</span>
<span class="poetry">Thinking of beautiful things we know;</span>
<span class="poetry">Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do,</span>
<span class="poetry">All complete, in a minute or two—</span>
<span class="poetry">Something noble and wise and good,</span>
<span class="poetry">Done by merely wishing we could.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">We’ve forgotten, but—never mind,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!</span>
<span class="poetry">All the talk we ever have heard</span>
<span class="poetry">Uttered by bat or beast or bird—</span>
<span class="poetry">Hide or fin or scale or feather—</span>
<span class="poetry">Jabber it quickly and all together!</span>
<span class="poetry">Excellent!  Wonderful!  Once again!</span>
<span class="poetry">Now we are talking just like men!</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Let’s pretend we are ... never mind,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">This is the way of the Monkey-kind.</span>
<span class="poetry">Then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines,</span>
<span class="poetry">That rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape swings.</span>
<span class="poetry">By the rubbish in our wake, and the noble noise we make,</span>
<span class="poetry">Be sure, be sure, we’re going to do some splendid things!</span>
