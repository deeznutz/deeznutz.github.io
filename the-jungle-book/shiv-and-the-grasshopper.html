<h1 class="chapter-header">Shiv and the Grasshopper</h1>
<p class="prose">(<i>The song that Toomai’s mother sang to the baby</i>)</p>
<span class="poetry">Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,</span>
<span class="poetry">Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,</span>
<span class="poetry">Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,</span>
<span class="poetry">From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">All things made he—Shiva the Preserver.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,—</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</span>
<span class="poetry">Wheat he gave to rich folk, millet to the poor,</span>
<span class="poetry">Broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door;</span>
<span class="poetry">Battle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,</span>
<span class="poetry">And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night.</span>
<span class="poetry">Naught he found too lofty, none he saw too low—</span>
<span class="poetry">Parbati beside him watched them come and go;</span>
<span class="poetry">Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest—</span>
<span class="poetry">Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  Turn and see.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine!</span>
<span class="poetry">When the dole was ended, laughingly she said,</span>
<span class="poetry">“Master, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?”</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Laughing, Shiv made answer, “All have had their part,</span>
<span class="poetry">Even he, the little one, hidden ‘neath thy heart.”</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">From her breast she plucked it, Parbati the thief,</span>
<span class="poetry">Saw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf!</span>
<span class="poetry">Saw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv,</span>
<span class="poetry">Who hath surely given meat to all that live.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">All things made he—Shiva the Preserver.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,—</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</span>
