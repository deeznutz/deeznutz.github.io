<p class="prose"><i>Elephants of the Gun Teams</i></p>
<span class="poetry">We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,</span>
<span class="poetry">The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;</span>
<span class="poetry">We bowed our necks to service: they ne’er were loosed again,—</span>
<span class="poetry">Make way there—way for the ten-foot teams</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Of the Forty-Pounder train!</span>
<p class="prose"><i>Gun Bollocks</i></p>
<span class="poetry">Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball,</span>
<span class="poetry">And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;</span>
<span class="poetry">Then we come into action and tug the guns again—</span>
<span class="poetry">Make way there—way for the twenty yoke</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Of the Forty-Pounder train!</span>
<p class="prose"><i>Cavalry Horses</i></p>
<span class="poetry">By the brand on my shoulder, the finest of tunes</span>
<span class="poetry">Is played by the Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons,</span>
<span class="poetry">And it’s sweeter than “Stables” or “Water” to me—</span>
<span class="poetry">The Cavalry Canter of “Bonnie Dundee”!</span>
<span class="poetry">Then feed us and break us and handle and groom,</span>
<span class="poetry">And give us good riders and plenty of room,</span>
<span class="poetry">And launch us in column of squadron and see</span>
<span class="poetry">The way of the war-horse to “Bonnie Dundee”!</span>
<p class="prose"><i>Screw-Gun Mules</i></p>
<span class="poetry">As me and my companions were scrambling up a hill,</span>
<span class="poetry">The path was lost in rolling stones, but we went forward still;</span>
<span class="poetry">For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,</span>
<span class="poetry">Oh, it’s our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">spare!</span>
<span class="poetry">Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road;</span>
<span class="poetry">Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load:</span>
<span class="poetry">For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,</span>
<span class="poetry">Oh, it’s our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">spare!</span>
<p class="prose"><i>Commissariat Camels</i></p>
<span class="poetry">We haven’t a camelty tune of our own</span>
<span class="poetry">To help us trollop along,</span>
<span class="poetry">But every neck is a hair trombone</span>
<span class="poetry">(Rtt-ta-ta-ta! is a hair trombone!)</span>
<span class="poetry">And this our marching-song:</span>
<span class="poetry">Can’t!  Don’t!  Shan’t!  Won’t!</span>
<span class="poetry">Pass it along the line!</span>
<span class="poetry">Somebody’s pack has slid from his back,</span>
<span class="poetry">Wish it were only mine!</span>
<span class="poetry">Somebody’s load has tipped off in the road—</span>
<span class="poetry">Cheer for a halt and a row!</span>
<span class="poetry">Urrr!  Yarrh!  Grr!  Arrh!</span>
<span class="poetry">Somebody’s catching it now!</span>
<p class="prose"><i>All The Beasts Together</i></p>
<span class="poetry">Children of the Camp are we,</span>
<span class="poetry">Serving each in his degree;</span>
<span class="poetry">Children of the yoke and goad,</span>
<span class="poetry">Pack and harness, pad and load.</span>
<span class="poetry">See our line across the plain,</span>
<span class="poetry">Like a heel-rope bent again,</span>
<span class="poetry">Reaching, writhing, rolling far,</span>
<span class="poetry">Sweeping all away to war!</span>
<span class="poetry">While the men that walk beside,</span>
<span class="poetry">Dusty, silent, heavy-eyed,</span>
<span class="poetry">Cannot tell why we or they</span>
<span class="poetry">March and suffer day by day.</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Children of the Camp are we,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Serving each in his degree;</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Children of the yoke and goad,</span>
<span class="poetry-indent">Pack and harness, pad and load!</span>
